# Step 1: open terminal


# Step 2: Load required libraries for the RNA sequence pipeline
module load sra-toolkit/2.10.8
module load samtools/1.9
module load fastqc/0.11.9
module load hisat2/2.1.0
module load subread/2.0.6

# Step 3: Download all the SRR files using fastq-dump
for i in {SRR13019394..SRR13019404}
do
  fastq-dump SRR${i}
done

# Step 4: Run FastQC (Quality control step)
for file in *.fastq
do
  fastqc $file
done

# Step 5: Download genome indices from HISAT2
curl -O https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/hisat/grch38_genome.tar.gz
tar -xvzf grch38_genome.tar.gz

# Step 6: Perform HISAT2 alignment for all the .fastq files
for file in *.fastq
do
  hisat2 -x grch38_genome -U $file -S ${file%.fastq}.sam
  samtools view -bS ${file%.fastq}.sam > ${file%.fastq}.bam
  samtools sort ${file%.fastq}.bam -o ${file%.fastq}_sorted.bam
  rm ${file%.fastq}.sam
  rm ${file%.fastq}.bam
done

# Step 7: The output is sorted .bam files, view with samtools
for file in *_sorted.bam
do
  samtools view $file
done

# Step 8: Quantification step using featureCounts
# Download gene annotation from Ensembl
curl -O http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-106/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf.gz
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf.gz

# Perform the quantification step for all the .bam files
featureCounts -a Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf -o counts.txt *_sorted.bam

# Step 9: Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and GEOquery in R
# Note: This step is performed in R, not in the Unix shell script

# Step 10: Download the metadata from the GEO database using GEO accession number GSE161199
# Note: This step is also performed in R

# Step 11: Create volcano plot and MD plot for DEGs
# Note: This step is performed in R

# Step 12: Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis using RShinyGO
# Note: This step is performed in R

# Step 13: List of top 10 Differentially Expressed Genes
# Note: This information is derived from the R analysis

# Completion message
echo "RNA-seq pipeline executed successfully."
